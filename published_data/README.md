# Data and pretrained models

Here we provide links to the molecules generated in the studies reported in the paper. This allows for reproduction of the shown graphs and statistics, as well as further analysis of the obtained molecules. Furthermore, we provide two pretrained cG-SchNet models that were used in our experiments, which enables sampling of additional molecules.

## Data bases with generated molecules
A zip-file containing the generated molecules can be found under [DOI 10.14279/depositonce-14977](http://dx.doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-14977).
It includes five folders with molecules generated by five cG-SchNet models conditioned on different combinations of properties.
They appear in the same order as in the paper, i.e. the first model is conditioned on isotropic polarizability, the second is conditioned on fingerprints, the third is conditioned on HOMO-LUMO gap and atomic composition, the fourth is conditioned on relative atomic energy and atomic composition, and the fifth is conditioned on HOMO-LUMO gap and relative atomic energy. Each folder contains several data bases following the naming convention _\<target values\>\_\<type\>.db_, where _\<target values\>_ lists the conditioning target values (separated with underscores) and _\<type\>_ is either _generated_ for raw, generated structures or _relaxed_ for the relaxed counterparts. For example _/4\_comp\_relenergy/c7o2h10\_-0.1\_relaxed.db_ contains relaxed molecules that were generated by the fourth cG-SchNet model (conditioned on atomic composition and relative atomic energy) using the composition c7o2h10 and a relative atomic energy of -0.1 eV as targets during sampling.

For help with the content of each data base, please call the script _data\_base\_help.py_ which will print the metadata of a selected database and help to get started:

```
python ./cG-SchNet/published_data/data_base_help.py <path-to-db>
```

For example, the output for the data base _/4\_comp\_relenergy/c7o2h10\_-0.1\_relaxed.db_ is as following:

```
INFO for data base at <path-to-db>
===========================================================================================================
Contains 2719 C7O2H10 isomers generated by cG-SchNet and subsequently relaxed with DFT calculations.
All reported energy values are in eV and a systematic offset between the ORCA reference calculations and the QM9 reference values was approximated and compensated. For reference, the uncompensated energy values directly obtained with ORCA are also provided.
The corresponding raw, generated version of each structure can be found in the data base of generated molecules using the provided "gen_idx" (caution, it starts from 0 whereas ase loads data bases counting from 1).
The field "rmsd" holds the root mean square deviation between the atom positions of the raw, generated structure and the relaxed equilibrium molecule in Ã… (it includes hydrogen atoms).
The field "changed" is 0 if the connectivity of the molecule before and after relaxation is identical (i.e. no bonds were broken or newly formed) and 1 if it did change.
Originally, all 3349 unique and valid C7O2H10 isomers among 100k molecules generated by cG-SchNet were chosen for relaxation. 7 of these did not converge to a valid configuration and 630 converged to equilibrium configurations already covered by other generated isomers (i.e. they were duplicate structures) and were therefore removed.

For example, here is the data stored with the first three molecules:
0: {'gen_idx': 0, 'computed_relative_atomic_energy': -0.11081359089212128, 'computed_energy_U0': -11512.699587841627, 'computed_energy_U0_uncompensated': -11512.578122651728, 'rmsd': 0.2492194704871389, 'changed': 0}
1: {'gen_idx': 1, 'computed_relative_atomic_energy': -0.13234655336327705, 'computed_energy_U0': -11513.108714128579, 'computed_energy_U0_uncompensated': -11512.98724893868, 'rmsd': 0.48381233235411153, 'changed': 0}
2: {'gen_idx': 2, 'computed_relative_atomic_energy': -0.11825264882338615, 'computed_energy_U0': -11512.84092994232, 'computed_energy_U0_uncompensated': -11512.719464752421, 'rmsd': 0.21804191287675742, 'changed': 0}

You can load and access the molecules and accompanying data by connecting to the data base with ASE, e.g. using the following code snippet:
from ase.db import connect
with connect(/home/niklas/phd/code/data/generated/4_comp_relenergy/c7o2h10_-0.1_relaxed.db) as con:
 	row = con.get(1)  # load the first molecule, 1-based indexing
 	R = row.positions  # positions of atoms as 3d coordinates
 	Z = row.numbers  # list of atomic numbers
 	data = row.data  # dictionary of data stored with the molecule

You can visualize the molecules in the data base with ASE from the command line by calling:
ase gui /home/niklas/phd/code/data/generated/4_comp_relenergy/c7o2h10_-0.1_relaxed.db
```
